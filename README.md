## 1.NAND Gate 
The NAND gate, short for "NOT-AND," is a fundamental logic gate in digital electronics. It is a combination of an AND gate followed by a NOT gate. A NAND gate has two or more inputs and one output. The output of a NAND gate is low (logical 0) only when all its inputs are high (logical 1). In all other input combinations, the output is high (logical 1).

The truth table for a NAND gate with two inputs is as follows:

The symbol for a NAND gate is similar to the symbol for an AND gate, but it includes a bubble at the end of the gate, indicating the NOT operation. The bubble is placed on the output side of the gate symbol.

## 2.AND Gate
The AND gate is a fundamental logic gate in digital electronics. It takes two binary inputs (0 or 1) and produces an output based on the logical combination of the inputs. The output of an AND gate is "1" only if both inputs are "1"; otherwise, the output is "0."

The AND gate can be represented by the following truth table:
