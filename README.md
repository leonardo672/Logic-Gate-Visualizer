## 1.NAND Gate 
The NAND gate, short for "NOT-AND," is a fundamental logic gate in digital electronics. It is a combination of an AND gate followed by a NOT gate. A NAND gate has two or more inputs and one output. The output of a NAND gate is low (logical 0) only when all its inputs are high (logical 1). In all other input combinations, the output is high (logical 1).

The truth table for a NAND gate with two inputs is as follows:

Input_A	  Input_B	  Output
0	           0	       1
0	           1	       1 
1	           0	       1
1	           1	       0
